# Show me a random file
I created this project of lack of interest in picking videos for a half filled 1 TB hard drive.
This project is a node.js based project to return a random file based on the search path provided.

# Getting Started
```
- git clone https://github.com/reubenkcoutinho/get_ranndom_file
- machine$ node index.js <Path/to/list/of/media/files> 
```

# Arguments

## `-e`
Exclude any folders listed within the current search directory
e.g [-e test done etc] 

## `-ft`
Search for specific file types
e.g. [-ft .avi .mp3 .mp4]
